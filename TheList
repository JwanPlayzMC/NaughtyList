Hey it's Jwan. I finally found out how to do this so your can get my thoughts and opinions on the mod and what not and you don't have to update the mod to see. 

Jwan's DBC Essentals Update 1.2.3: The Potara Update
-Potara now has a configurable multiplier
-You can now look at yourself in Destroyer with being destroyed
-You have to hold Ascend Button to transform
-Majin Costs now work
